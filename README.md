Storing game files for and serve them to my unblocked games website

Things such as swf, html, css, js and other files are added here

If you see a file named test.txt, it's there to make sure CORS policy for this site is working as it's supposed to

Submit an issue if theres a problem, or if you just want a game to be added.
