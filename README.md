Storing game files for and serve them to my unblocked games website

This is turning into more of a content server for my projects so i don't have to make more repos

Things such as swf, html, css, js and other files are added here

If you see a file named test.txt, it's there to make sure CORS policy for this site is working as it's supposed to

Submit an issue if theres a problem, or if you just want something to be added.
